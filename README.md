# Automated Linear Regression CI/CD Pipeline

This project implements a simple Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for training and deploying a linear regression model. The pipeline automates the process from training the model to deploying it, ensuring seamless integration and deployment. This repository serves as a guide for setting up and utilizing the pipeline effectively.
